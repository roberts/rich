/**

   I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for
   freedom in the history of our nation.

   Five score years ago a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the
   Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree is a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro
   slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the
   long night of their captivity. But 100 years later the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later the
   life of the Negro is still badly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.
   One hundred years later the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of
   material prosperity. One hundred years later the Negro is still languished in the corners of American
   society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful
   condition.

   In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our Republic wrote
   the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a
   promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men—yes,
   black men as well as white men—would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the
   pursuit of happiness..

   We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our
   creative protests to degenerate into physical violence. . . . The marvelous new militancy which has
   engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to distrust all white people, for many of our white
   brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up
   with our destiny.

   ...We cannot walk alone. And as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.
   We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, “When will you be
   satisfied?” We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of
   police brutality.

   We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in
   the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.

   We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro’s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We
   can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their adulthood and robbed of their dignity
   by signs stating “For Whites Only.”

   We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and the Negro in New York
   believes he has nothing for which to vote.

   No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and
   righteousness like a mighty stream..

   I say to you today, my friends, though, even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still 
   have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this
   nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that
   all men are created equal.”

   I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia sons of former slaves and the sons of former
   slave-owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day
   even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of
   oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by
   the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream . . . I have a dream that one
   day in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of
   interposition and nullification, one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able
   to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
   I have a dream today..

   This will be the day when all of God’s children will be able to sing with new meaning. “My country, ’tis of
   thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim’s pride, from
   every mountain side, let freedom ring.” And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. So
   let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty
   mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let
   freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado. Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of
   California.

   But not only that. Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia. Let freedom ring from Lookout
   Mountain of Tennessee. Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi, from every
   mountain side. Let freedom ring..

   When we allow freedom to ring—when we let it ring from every city and every hamlet, from every state
   and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white
   men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the
   old Negro spiritual, “Free at last, Free at last, Great God a-mighty, We are free at last.”

 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
